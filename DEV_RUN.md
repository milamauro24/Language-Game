# Run the Language Game locally

This workspace now includes a minimal Vite + React scaffold so you can run the `App` component in `src/App.jsx`.

Steps:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd /project/workspace
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Note: this adds a small dev scaffold and does not modify your original `main` file.
